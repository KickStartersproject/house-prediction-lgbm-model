## Usage

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/KickStartersproject/house-prediction-lgbm-model.git

# change to the repo directory
cd house-prediction-lgbm-model

# create a virtualenv
py -m venv venv

# activate virtualenv for linux or mac
source venv/bin/activate

# activate virtualenv for windows
# venv\Scripts\activate

# install dependencies (this would install flask and other python libraries)
pip install -r dependencies.txt

# open app in visual studio code and on terminal run the following command to set flask main app
set FLASK_APP=main.py

```

## Model Development

### Model

The model is based on a [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) algorithm.

### Training

```python
import lightgbm as lgb

model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(max_depth=3, 
                    n_estimators = 100, 
                    learning_rate = 0.2,
                    min_child_samples = 10)
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

Grid Search Cross Validation is used for hyper parameters of the model.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

params = [{"max_depth":[3, 5], 
            "n_estimators" : [50, 100], 
            "learning_rate" : [0.1, 0.2],
            "min_child_samples" : [20, 10]}]

gs_knn = GridSearchCV(model,
                      param_grid=params,
                      cv=5)

gs_knn.fit(x_train, y_train)
gs_knn.score(x_train, y_train)

pred_y_train = model.predict(x_train)
pred_y_test = model.predict(x_test)

r2_train = metrics.r2_score(y_train, pred_y_train)
r2_test = metrics.r2_score(y_test, pred_y_test)

msle_train =metrics.mean_squared_log_error(y_train, pred_y_train)
msle_test =metrics.mean_squared_log_error(y_test, pred_y_test)

print(f"Train r2 = {r2_train:.2f} \nTest r2 = {r2_test:.2f}")
print(f"Train msle = {msle_train:.2f} \nTest msle = {msle_test:.2f}")

print(gs_knn.best_params_)

```

## Deployment

```
On terminal run the following command to start the app on the default port: 5000
flask run

i.e http://127.0.0.1:5000

```
